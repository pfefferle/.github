## Intrduction
Default files for @pfefferle repositories.

GitHub will use and display default files for any public repository that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- the root of the repository
- the `.github` folder
- the `docs` folder


The files are not included in `clones`, `packages`, or `downloads` of individual repositories because they are stored only in the `.github` repository.
